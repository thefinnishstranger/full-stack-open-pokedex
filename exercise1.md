I have picked Java as the language that I will talk about in this section, as I have used a little Java before but not as much as javascript/react. From google searching I have learned that the most used linting tool is Checkstyle. For testing most developers suggest Selenium, but it has a steeper learning curve. For building Java software the most popular CI tool is Jenkins, which can also be used with JavaScript. Some other CI alternatives that I have found is CircleCI and Travis CI, which both work for Java based software. It is more used in cloud based due to the slowness and the stream of security problems that are associated with the Java programming language. I've also seen people say hybrid, where you use both self-hosted and cloud services. Most of the time developers state that it depends on the type of job that you're doing. If the storage is cheap on the cloud and fulfills your requirements then that's the better option, but if you have a lot of privacy requirements then you're better of self-hosting as that's more protected than cloud services. Storing everything in the cloud can also get very expensive really quickly so one must sit down and look over the numbers to see which one is more viable for the project.
